Mobility of people and availability of goods is a fundamental part of the modern society and generates tremendous economic and social value. However, growing transport volumes pose challenges such as climate change, environmental pollution and traffic accidents.

Maybe you haven't experienced all theses situations, but you surely know what it is about and how it affect people's lives.

## The vision of a sustainable future is what drives Chalmers

You all are acquainted with Chalmers masters' programs. 

So you know that, to achieve this vision, besides the consolidated departments of education, Chalmers has organized students, researchers and professors in areas of advance. 

Areas of Advance are all about **interdisciplinarity**, interaction between people; between researchers within and outside Chalmers, between researchers and students at Chalmers, between Chalmers and the surrounding world.

## Areas of Advance

- Energy   
- Health Engineering   
- Information and Communication Technology

???

The Areas of Advance are challenge driven thematic platforms for strategy and long-term collaboration to address specific relevant challenges for industry and society. They also offer common access to cutting-edge research infrastructures as well as to several targeted centres. 

At the same time, Chalmers' departments represent a continuous source of expertise. And it is this, the interplay between the departments and the Areas of Advance, that is so instrumental to our success!

Transport area of Advance creates new knowledge to meet transport-related sustainability challenges. 

Current research themes are autonomous transport, electromobility and the transition to future transport systems.

The profile includes two highly interrelated areas, reflecting two main perspectives, where researchers meet to jointly develop multidisciplinary research, education and innovation. These areas are demand for transport and logistics and supply of transport and logistics

## Sustainable Development Goals set - UN
 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}

???

So, we address these Sustainable Development Goals: 


SDG 9 - Industry, innovation and infrastructure
Redefining urban development strategies for effective and efficient future mobility solutions.
Investigating the role of new technology for making goods transport more efficient.

SDG 11 - Sustainable cities and communities   

Virtual multimodal infrastructure for smart cities, providing more reliable and responsive transportation services, and thus improving the lives of urban dwellers.
Development of an electrical ferry, contributing to reduced pollution in cities.
A common framework of concepts and methods to investigate how sustainable modes of individual, non-motorized and collective motorized mobility have come into conflict with modern car-dominated urban city planning and traffic engineering.
Enabling cities/municipalities to evaluate the different scenarios of a mixed vehicular traffic and their impact on traffic safety and efficiency.
Researching the transition to sustainable business practices for retailing and transport as well as to sustainable consumer behaviour.

### Investigation objectives 

.purple[
- Create the potential for **effective**, **sustainable** and **social responsible** urban logistics solutions;

- Enhance **livability**, **equitable access to opportunities**, **social justice** and **quality of life** in cities through the **coordination** among **mobility systems**, **land use** and the **spatial structure of urban activities and functions**;  

- **Characterise**, **diagnose** and **assess** the relationship between **production, distribution and consumption structures** on **inequitable access to food and other essential goods** in urban areas.  
  
- Investigate **causal** relationships among **urban logistics** systems and the **urban spatial structure**, identifying relevant factors that **drive demand for goods**, considering the **customer as an active agent** in urban logistics.

# Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering
## Architecture and planning beyond sustainability, MSc
## Architecture and urban design, MSc

Creates the architects and civil engineers of the future, through education and research. Looking at engineering and social science, architecture and humanities, for the benefit of a sustainable society.

he education leads to a wide range of career opportunities within architecture, urban design, and planning for sustainable development as a response to increasing awareness and commitment among both public and private actors.
A master’s degree in architecture and urban design offers a wide range of career opportunities, from practice to research. Most of our courses have a strong connection and collaboration with industry and real projects. 
Graduates work in architecture and urban design offices, city planning offices, and governmental bodies.

---
Computer Science and Engineering
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (abbreviated CSE) has close to 300 employees who are engaged in education and research in a wide range of disciplines and areas of expertise from basic research to applications. We educate for the future and create social benefits through our research that is brought to life and implemented in close cooperation with business and industry. Our operations has a strong international character. The department is joint between Chalmers and University of Gothenburg.

Most of the research at Data Science and AI is in cooperation with partners in academia and industry, which is combined with basic research in machine learning and related areas:
algorithm theory (design, complexity, randomness)
optimization and operations research (scheduling, routing)
theoretical ML research (learning, decision-making)
health informatics, bioinformatics and computational biology
natural language processing (text analysis, representation learning, multimodality)
autonomous vehicles
mathematical modelling and problem solving 

Interaction Design and Software Engineering
Interaction Design concerns the interaction between people and products in which information technology is a central component. This can, for instance, be the interface and gameplay of modern computer games, the design of the complex interface between the driver and the network of computers controlling a modern car, the next generation of mobile communication devices or the integration of computational technology into our everyday things, such as "intelligent clothes". Regardless of application area, a design perspective on the interaction between people and technology is central. This makes interaction design an increasingly important area in application and systems development, as well as in industrial and product design.


---
Technology Management and Economics
The department conducts outstanding research within Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Operations and Supply Chain Management, Environmental Assessment and Transition Studies, and the role of Technology in Society. The department has six research divisions, one division for support functions and hosts three research centres. Our work is related to most of Chalmers' Areas of Advance.

The vision of a sustainable future is what drives Chalmers.

Chalmers’ Areas of Advance are all about interaction between people; between researchers within and outside Chalmers, between researchers and students at Chalmers, between Chalmers and the surrounding world.
